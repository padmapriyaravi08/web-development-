        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic framework for web pages by using a system of tags and elements to define different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. Each HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and is structured using <html>, <head>, and <body> sections.<br>While HTML defines the content and layout, it is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design and JavaScript for interactivity. In essence, HTML is the backbone of every website, allowing browsers to interpret and display text, media, and links in an organized and user-friendly way.
