Using the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) payload onboard India’s first dedicated space based solar mission, Aditya-L1, scientists at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) along with NASA have collaborated to estimate the crucial parameters of a coronal mass ejection (CME), very close to its lift-off from the Sun.


Scientists associated with the project said that these are the very first spectroscopic observations of a CME in the visible wavelength range.


They said that the unique spectroscopic observations with the VELC has let them study the CMEs very close to the Sun’s visible surface itself, for the first time.

“In addition, it provides a sustained view of the Sun for 24 hours everyday because of being at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location where the Sun never sets,” they said.

Taking advantage of these factors, Dr. V. Muthupriyal (VELC Project Scientist) and her colleagues in the VELC payload operations centre at the IIA estimated the electron density, energy, mass, temperature and speed of a CME very close to the Sun.</p> <hr>

India's Top Tennis Star Suffers Visa Setback Ahead Of Australian Open Playoffs

India's No.1 ranked tennis player, Sumit Nagal, on Tuesday urged the Chinese Ambassador to India and the Chinese Embassy in India for assistance after his China visa was rejected. Nagal is set to participate in the Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wildcard Play-off, a qualifying event for the 2026 Australian Open. The tournament is scheduled to be held from November 24 to 29, 2025, in Chengdu, China. By competing in this event, Nagal will have the chance to secure a wildcard entry into the prestigious Australian Open 2026.

</p> 
<p class="sports">After losing his place in top-100, Nagal cannot enter the top events like Grand Slams as direct entrant and would depend on wild card entries or Qualifiers. The 27-year-old from Jhajjar, Haryana, is currently India's highest-ranked singles player, placed 275 in the latest ATP standings. He was scheduled to travel to Chengdu to compete in the Australian Open Playoff event, which will give the regional players a main-draw entry into the 2026 Australian Open.

There has been no immediate response from the Chinese embassy or tournament organisers regarding the issue.

If the matter is not resolved swiftly, Nagal would be forced to miss the event, which could hurt his chances to enter 2026 season's first Grand Slam.

Last year, he competed in Australian Open main draw, losing in the opening round and fell in the qualifying for Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

He played a crucial role in India's Davis Cup win over Switzerland, winning both his singles against lower-ranked players.

<p class="states">A major multi-state terror module linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind has been busted in a joint operation by Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana police. The crackdown on what is being called a 'white-collar terror ecosystem' has led to eight arrests, including three doctors, and the seizure of nearly 2,900 kg of explosives. Among those arrested are Dr. Muzammil Ganaie from Faridabad, Dr. Adeel Rather from Saharanpur, and Dr. Shaheen Shahid, a woman doctor from Lucknow, from whose car an AK-47 was recovered. An anchor on the broadcast stated, 'Take a moment viewers for just a moment to reflect on the enormity of this situation where you have doctors who trained for years in the practice of medicine joining hands together to give form to a terror module'. The investigation has also linked a fourth doctor, Umar Muhammad, to a recent deadly car blast near Delhi's Red Fort. 

</p> 
<p class="states">A high-intensity explosion shook the national capital on Monday evening when a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car exploded at a traffic signal near the Red Fort during peak hours. The powerful blast killed at least nine people and left dozens injured, gutting several vehicles and sparking widespread panic in the crowded area. A video, captured on the camera of a YouTuber, showed people running for their lives as the deafening blast reverberated meters away, with many screaming, “Run! Run!” amid the chaos. </p>
